# Welcome! 👋

Hey there! Welcome to my very professional blog where I share thoughts on coding, data science projects, and various experiments. This site is built with some cool tech and serves as both a learning platform and a place to share ideas.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog focuses on:

- **Data Science Projects**: Python notebooks, analysis workflows, and insights
- **Vibe Coding**: Fun experiments with modern web tech
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Exploring concepts, tools, and best practices
- **A/B Testing**: Because why not experiment with everything?

<Callout type="info">
This entire blog is open source and serves as a learning playground. Feel free to explore the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/EHam1/very-professional-blog).
</Callout>

## Tech Stack

This site is built with a modern, performant stack:

```javascript
const techStack = {
  framework: "Next.js 14",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  content: "MDX",
  analytics: "Supabase",
  deployment: "Vercel",
  abTesting: "Custom implementation"
};
```

### Why This Stack?

**Next.js** provides excellent performance with static site generation, **MDX** lets me write posts with interactive React components, and **Supabase** gives me a free PostgreSQL database for analytics that I can query with SQL.

Here's a quick Python example of how you might analyze the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from supabase import create_client

# Connect to Supabase
supabase = create_client(url, key)

# Get page view data
response = supabase.table("events") \
    .select("*") \
    .eq("event", "page-view") \
    .execute()

# Analyze with pandas
df = pd.DataFrame(response.data)
views_by_page = df.groupby('page').size().sort_values(ascending=False)

print(f"Total page views: {len(df)}")
print(f"\nTop pages:\n{views_by_page.head()}")
```

<Callout type="success">
The best part? All analytics data is accessible via SQL, making it perfect for data scientists who want to analyze user behavior with familiar tools.

## A/B Testing in Action

Let's test different call-to-action messages. You're seeing one of two variants:

<ABTest experiment="welcome-cta">
  <ABTest.Variant name="A">
    <div className="bg-blue-100 border-2 border-blue-300 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-2">Want to learn more?</h3>
      <p className="text-blue-800">Subscribe to get notified when I publish new posts about data science and web development.</p>
      <button className="mt-4 bg-blue-600 text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-blue-700 transition">
        Subscribe Now
      </button>
    </div>
  </ABTest.Variant>
  
  <ABTest.Variant name="B">
    <div className="bg-green-100 border-2 border-green-300 rounded-lg p-6 my-6">
      <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-green-900 mb-2">Join the community!</h3>
      <p className="text-green-800">Get exclusive updates on new posts, projects, and experiments delivered straight to your inbox.</p>
      <button className="mt-4 bg-green-600 text-white px-6 py-2 rounded-lg hover:bg-green-700 transition">
        Get Updates
      </button>
    </div>
  </ABTest.Variant>
</ABTest>

The system automatically assigns you to a variant and tracks which version you saw. Later, I can analyze the data to see which message resonates better!

## Markdown Features

Of course, all the standard Markdown features work great:

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Item three

### Numbered Lists

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

### Links and Emphasis

You can use **bold text**, *italic text*, and [links](https://github.com/EHam1) throughout your posts.

### Code Blocks

Inline code looks `like this`, and code blocks support syntax highlighting for many languages.

<Callout type="warning">
**Note**: This is still a work in progress! More features and posts coming soon.
</Callout>

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:

- Setting up data pipelines with Python
- Modern web development patterns
- Analytics and experimentation best practices
- Personal projects and learnings

Stay tuned for more content!
