## Why Create a Card Game

I love many of the ideas and projects that come from the open source community. I tend to think of the "open source community" as a scattered group of mostly computer scientists 
shipping code to improve ecosystems, coding languages, information sharing protocols. And while I'm no computer scientist, 
I always thought it would feel great to contribute to part of the shared vision. It dawned on me recently that card games are 
a sort of open source community themselves. Nobody is buying or selling, all information is free, and anyone can contribute, 
change, or fork existing ideas to suit their needs. So while many comrades on LinkedIn are building amazing new Python packages, 
I set out to create my own card game that I could share with the world. It might not make as much of a splash on LinkedIn, and it
may not have much of an impact on the data science community, but I do hope this contribution to the "open source fun" community gets a few 
more people connecting and creating that otherwise might not have.

## Game Design from Scratch

### 1) Pillars → Constraints → Core Verb

**Pillars** (3 short lines): pace, agency, depth.

**Constraints**: components (52-card deck), players (2–6), teach time (less than 2 minutes), round length (less than 20 minutes).

**Core Verb**: the repeatable thing players do (e.g., build / claim / draft / program / race / meld). Everything else serves this.

### 2) Information & Tension

**Information structure**: open market vs. hidden hands; simultaneous reveals; peeks.

**One tension engine to start**: Tempo (act early vs. strong), Risk (press-your-luck), Interaction (steal/block), or Scarcity (dwindling supply). Don't stack three at once on day one.

### 3) Win Condition Before Rules

Race to X points, or most points when trigger hits, or first to claim N objectives.

The win condition shapes the economy (costs/points).

### 4) Scoring Bundles (2–4 lanes, max)

Each lane = a bundle (e.g., Route, Structure, Army).

Make each lane: (a) distinct skill, (b) distinct cost pattern, (c) distinct payoff curve.

Give one or two end-round bonuses to push long-horizon plans (e.g., Longest Route).

### 5) Turn Economy

Keep a heartbeat: Draw 1 → up to 1 Build + 1 Action.

Use a hand limit to push commits and prevent hoarding.

Add a micro-tempo bonus on build only if play stalls (draw 1, or Market).

### 6) Point Calibration via Rarity & Efficiency

Start from rarity counts (combinatorics) and efficiency (cards per point).

Set baseline points with a small formula (see Resource 2), then playtest and nudge.

### 7) Interaction Boundaries

Limit "take-that" with costs or cooldowns (spend a face card).

Provide defense (Shield) so interaction creates reads, not resentment.

### 8) Playtest Loop (tight)

2–3 rounds, time it, log which lane won, track dead turns.

Change one knob; iterate.

When two lanes dominate, boost the third by +1 point or easing its recipe.

## OUTPOST: Galactic Expansion (First Draft)

**Players**: 2–5 (best at 4)

**Deck**: Standard 52-card deck

**Goal**: Be the first to reach 10 points

**Theme**: Build outposts and colonies, forge trade routes, and assemble fleets. Beware the Space Worm…

### Setup

1. Shuffle the deck. Deal 3 cards to each player.
2. Place the rest face-down as the **Sector Deck**; create a face-up **Worm Pit** discard pile.
3. Choose a start player.

### Turn Structure

On your turn:

1. **Draw 1** from the Sector Deck.
2. Take up to **1 Build + 1 Action** (max one of each; you may also do just one or pass).
3. **Hand limit 6** at end of turn (discard extras to the Worm Pit).

If the deck empties, shuffle the Worm Pit to form a new Sector Deck.

### Builds (score points)

Play the required cards face-up to your tableau; discard the rest used to pay.

**Outpost — 1 pt**
- Cost: Pair of any rank (2–A), any suits.

**Colony — 3 pt**
- Cost: Three ascending ranks with alternating colors (R-B-R or B-R-B; suits flexible).

**Trade Route — 3 pt for a 3-card route, +1 for each extra card beyond 3**
- Cost: Consecutive ranks in the same suit (e.g., 6♠-7♠-8♠-9♠ = 4 pts).
- v1 rule: Routes are one-shot builds (you can't extend later).

**Fleet — 2 pt**
- Cost: K + Q (any suits). Place the set to your tableau and discard them after scoring.

**Bonuses:**
- **Largest Fleet**: At game end, the player with the most Fleet sets gains +2. (Ties: nobody.)
- **Longest Trade Network**: At game end, the player with the highest total route length gains +2. (Ties: nobody.)

### Actions (face cards; play & discard to use)

- **J = Spy**: Look at up to 2 cards in a target's hand (no swapping).
- **Q = Shield**: You are immune to Spy/Raid until your next turn.
- **K = Raid**: Steal 1 random card from a target's hand (fails if they're Shielded).

*(Optional "Market" smoothing—discard 1 numeric → draw 1—is OFF in v1. Add later if needed.)*

### Space Worm Alert! (slap mechanic)

When a player builds a **Colony** or completes a **Fleet**, the Space Worm stirs: everyone races to slap the center.

- **Last to slap**: discard 1 random card (the Worm eats it).
- **False alarm**: Slapping without a trigger makes you discard 1 random card.

### End of Game

The first player to reach **10 points wins immediately**.

If the deck runs out and nobody has 10+, finish the current round; highest score wins.

## Now What? 

As I mentioned in the Game Design section, an important piece of making the game flow well is calibrating the 
points and scoring system based on the frequency of events and interactions. I plan to go about this in two different 
ways to converge on the "optimal" scoring system for OUTPOST. 

1. Math: start by examining rarity counts (combinatorics) for each game event. Next, figure out a points system such that 
the frequency of the event is inversly correlated with the number of points that event merits (more on that calculation later).

2. Playtest: play a few rounds with a group of people and keep tabs on game metrics, such as build totals at the end of each 
round, time to win each round, what strategies tend to be most succesful and is it obviously imbalanced over time etc.
