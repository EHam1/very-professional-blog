# My First Post

I've had many ideas of apps or systems I want to build, but as a data analyst and data scientist I never had the full skillset to bring these things to live. 
Modern AI tools are removing all these barriers, and while I still don't know what I'm doing, I can get MVPs up and running in minutes all on my own. So here we go. 
Let's see what I can come up with and how much I break along the way. 

## The Code

I want to test what the code formatting looks like in this blog I'm buidling, so here's a sample:

```python
def hello_world():
    """A simple function to get started."""
    message = "Hello from my blog!"
    print(message)
    return message

# Run the function
result = hello_world()
print(f"Result: {result}")
```

## Testing Callout Components

Here are the different callout styles you can use:

<Callout type="info">
This is an **info** callout. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
This is a **warning** callout. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="success">
This is a **success** callout. 
</Callout>

<Callout type="error">
This is an **error** callout. 
</Callout>

## Testing A/B Testing

This feature lets you test different content versions. Try refreshing the page or clearing cookies to see variant B:

<ABTest experiment="intro-test">
  <ABTest.Variant name="A">
    **Variant A:** This is the first version of the content. It's more formal and technical.
  </ABTest.Variant>
  <ABTest.Variant name="B">
    **Variant B:** This is the second version! It's more casual and friendly. 😊
  </ABTest.Variant>
</ABTest>

## Other Markdown Features

Here's what else works:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links to external sites](https://github.com)
- `inline code snippets`
- Lists (like this one!)

### Different code languages:

JavaScript example:

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return `Welcome to the blog`;
};
```

Bash example:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

## Wrap Up

That should be enough of a test for now. Check out how everything renders!
